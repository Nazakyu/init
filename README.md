## What is project init?
**Init is an opportunity to discover system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily  basis.**

### Scripts

- Script 01: displays only the login, UID and Path of each entry of the /etc/passwd file.
- Script 02: delete an active user.
- Script 03: ask the user what does he want to install on his new machine: sudo, ssh, vim or zsh. The user select one or several of the choices, the install will be done if not installed yet, or it will update it if it is already installed.
